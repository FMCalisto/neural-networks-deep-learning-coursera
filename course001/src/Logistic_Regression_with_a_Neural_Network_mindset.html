# # Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
# 
# Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.
# 
# **Instructions:**
# - Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
# - Use `np.dot(X,Y)` to calculate dot products.
# 
# **You will learn to:**
# - Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
#     - Initializing parameters
#     - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
#     - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
# - Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

# ## 1 - Packages ##
# 
# First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment. 
# - [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
# - [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
# - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
# - [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.

# ## 2 - Overview of the Problem set ##
# 
# **Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
#     - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
#     - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
#     - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
# 
# You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
# 
# Let's get more familiar with the dataset. Load the data by running the following code.

# In[ ]:


# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)
train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()


# We added "_orig" at the end of image datasets (train and test) because we are going to preprocess them. After preprocessing, we will end up with train_set_x and test_set_x (the labels train_set_y and test_set_y don't need any preprocessing).
# 
# Each line of your train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. You can visualize an example by running the following code. Feel free also to change the `index` value and re-run to see other images. 

# In[ ]:


# Example of a picture
index = 25
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[:, index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:, index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")


# Many software bugs in deep learning come from having matrix/vector dimensions that don't fit. If you can keep your matrix/vector dimensions straight you will go a long way toward eliminating many bugs.

# ### Exercise 1
# Find the values for:
#     - m_train (number of training examples)
#     - m_test (number of test examples)
#     - num_px (= height = width of a training image)
# Remember that `train_set_x_orig` is a numpy-array of shape (m_train, num_px, num_px, 3). For instance, you can access `m_train` by writing `train_set_x_orig.shape[0]`.

# For convenience, you should now reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) in a numpy-array of shape (num_px $*$ num_px $*$ 3, 1). After this, our training (and test) dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image. There should be m_train (respectively m_test) columns.

# ### Exercise 2
# Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape (num\_px $*$ num\_px $*$ 3, 1).
# 
# A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b$*$c$*$d, a) is to use: 
# ```python
# X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X

# To represent color images, the red, green and blue channels (RGB) must be specified for each pixel, and so the pixel value is actually a vector of three numbers ranging from 0 to 255.
# 
# One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).
# 
# <!-- During the training of your model, you're going to multiply weights and add biases to some initial inputs in order to observe neuron activations. Then you backpropogate with the gradients to train the model. But, it is extremely important for each feature to have a similar range such that our gradients don't explode. You will see that more in detail later in the lectures. !-->

# Let's standardize our dataset.

#     
#     
# **What you need to remember:**
# 
# Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
# - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
# - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
# - "Standardize" the data

# ## 3 - General Architecture of the learning algorithm ##
# 
# It's time to design a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.
# 
# You will build a Logistic Regression, using a Neural Network mindset. The following Figure explains why **Logistic Regression is actually a very simple Neural Network!**
# 
# <img src="images/LogReg_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:400px;">
# 
# **Mathematical expression of the algorithm**:
# 
# For one example $x^{(i)}$:
# $$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# $$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{2}$$ 
# $$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) =  - y^{(i)}  \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} )  \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{3}$$
# 
# The cost is then computed by summing over all training examples:
# $$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{6}$$
# 
# **Key steps**:
# In this exercise, you will carry out the following steps: 
#     - Initialize the parameters of the model
#     - Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost  
#     - Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set)
#     - Analyse the results and conclude

# <a name='4'></a>
# ## 4 - Building the parts of our algorithm ## 
# 
# The main steps for building a Neural Network are:
# 1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features) 
# 2. Initialize the model's parameters
# 3. Loop:
#     - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
#     - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
#     - Update parameters (gradient descent)
# 
# You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call `model()`.
# 
# <a name='4-1'></a>
# ### 4.1 - Helper functions
# 
# <a name='ex-3'></a>
# ### Exercise 3 - sigmoid
# Using your code from "Python Basics", implement `sigmoid()`. As you've seen in the figure above, you need to compute $sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ for $z = w^T x + b$ to make predictions. Use np.exp().

# 
# Now that your parameters are initialized, you can do the "forward" and "backward" propagation steps for learning the parameters.
# 
# <a name='ex-5'></a>
# ### Exercise 5 - propagate
# Implement a function `propagate()` that computes the cost function and its gradient.
# 
# **Hints**:
# 
# Forward Propagation:
# - You get X
# - You compute $A = \sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(1)}, a^{(2)}, ..., a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$
# - You calculate the cost function: $J = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)})$
# 
# Here are the two formulas you will be using: 
# 
# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T\tag{7}$$
# $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})\tag{8}$$

# 
# 2. Convert the entries of a into 0 (if activation <= 0.5) or 1 (if activation > 0.5), stores the predictions in a vector `Y_prediction`. If you wish, you can use an `if`/`else` statement in a `for` loop (though there is also a way to vectorize this).

# If you pass all the tests, run the following cell to train your model.

# In[ ]:


logistic_regression_model = model(train_set_x, train_set_y, test_set_x, test_set_y, num_iterations=2000, learning_rate=0.005, print_cost=True)


# **Comment**: Training accuracy is close to 100%. This is a good sanity check: your model is working and has high enough capacity to fit the training data. Test accuracy is 70%. It is actually not bad for this simple model, given the small dataset we used and that logistic regression is a linear classifier. But no worries, you'll build an even better classifier next week!
# 
# Also, you see that the model is clearly overfitting the training data. Later in this specialization you will learn how to reduce overfitting, for example by using regularization. Using the code below (and changing the `index` variable) you can look at predictions on pictures of the test set.

# In[ ]:


# Example of a picture that was wrongly classified.
index = 1
plt.imshow(test_set_x[:, index].reshape((num_px, num_px, 3)))
print ("y = " + str(test_set_y[0,index]) + ", you predicted that it is a \"" + classes[int(logistic_regression_model['Y_prediction_test'][0,index])].decode("utf-8") +  "\" picture.")


# Let's also plot the cost function and the gradients.

# In[ ]:


# Plot learning curve (with costs)
costs = np.squeeze(logistic_regression_model['costs'])
plt.plot(costs)
plt.ylabel('cost')
plt.xlabel('iterations (per hundreds)')
plt.title("Learning rate =" + str(logistic_regression_model["learning_rate"]))
plt.show()


# **Interpretation**:
# You can see the cost decreasing. It shows that the parameters are being learned. However, you see that you could train the model even more on the training set. Try to increase the number of iterations in the cell above and rerun the cells. You might see that the training set accuracy goes up, but the test set accuracy goes down. This is called overfitting.

# ## 6 - Further analysis (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
# 
# Congratulations on building your first image classification model. Let's analyze it further, and examine possible choices for the learning rate $\alpha$. 

# #### Choice of learning rate ####
# 
# **Reminder**:
# In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.
# 
# Let's compare the learning curve of our model with several choices of learning rates. Run the cell below. This should take about 1 minute. Feel free also to try different values than the three we have initialized the `learning_rates` variable to contain, and see what happens. 

# In[ ]:


learning_rates = [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
models = {}

for lr in learning_rates:
    print ("Training a model with learning rate: " + str(lr))
    models[str(lr)] = model(train_set_x, train_set_y, test_set_x, test_set_y, num_iterations=1500, learning_rate=lr, print_cost=False)
    print ('\n' + "-------------------------------------------------------" + '\n')

for lr in learning_rates:
    plt.plot(np.squeeze(models[str(lr)]["costs"]), label=str(models[str(lr)]["learning_rate"]))

plt.ylabel('cost')
plt.xlabel('iterations (hundreds)')

legend = plt.legend(loc='upper center', shadow=True)
frame = legend.get_frame()
frame.set_facecolor('0.90')
plt.show()


# **Interpretation**: 
# - Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
# - If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost). 
# - A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
# - In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: 
#     - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
#     - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.)

# ## 7 - Test with your own image (optional/ungraded exercise) ##
# 
# Congratulations on finishing this assignment. You can use your own image and see the output of your model. To do that:
#     1. Click on "File" in the upper bar of this notebook, then click "Open" to go on your Coursera Hub.
#     2. Add your image to this Jupyter Notebook's directory, in the "images" folder
#     3. Change your image's name in the following code
#     4. Run the code and check if the algorithm is right (1 = cat, 0 = non-cat)!

# In[ ]:


# change this to the name of your image file
my_image = "my_image.jpg"   

# We preprocess the image to fit your algorithm.
fname = "images/" + my_image
image = np.array(Image.open(fname).resize((num_px, num_px)))
plt.imshow(image)
image = image / 255.
image = image.reshape((1, num_px * num_px * 3)).T
my_predicted_image = predict(logistic_regression_model["w"], logistic_regression_model["b"], image)

print("y = " + str(np.squeeze(my_predicted_image)) + ", your algorithm predicts a \"" + classes[int(np.squeeze(my_predicted_image)),].decode("utf-8") +  "\" picture.")


# <font color='blue'>
#     
# **What to remember from this assignment:**
# 1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
# 2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
# 3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!

# Finally, if you'd like, we invite you to try different things on this Notebook. Make sure you submit before trying anything. Once you submit, things you can play with include:
#     - Play with the learning rate and the number of iterations
#     - Try different initialization methods and compare the results
#     - Test other preprocessings (center the data, or divide each row by its standard deviation)
